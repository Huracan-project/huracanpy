    "The first two plots use the JTWC version of IBTrACS in huracanpy because it has more\n",

    "- The first figure shows a plot of maximum intensity for all the TCs in the JTWC dataset\n",
    "- The second figure plots separate colors for each basin. This shows the consistency of North Atlantic and East Pacific basins, in which JTWC define wind speeds a 1-minute sustained winds, whereas other basins use longer time periods\n",
    "- The third figure is a repeat of the second figure, but using the WMO version of IBTrACS. In this case the wind definitions are different for each basin and we see less consistent pressure-wind relations across basins"
