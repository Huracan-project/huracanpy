=========
HuracanPy
=========

A python package for working with various forms of feature tracking data, including but not restricted to cyclone tracks.

**Why HuracanPy?**
The idea of this package is to provide a common tool for working with cyclone track data. 
In particular, HuracanPy can read tracks from many different sources/trackers. 
It also provides useful functions to analyse these tracks, including many common diagnostics.
Our goal is to make track data analysis more accessible, and to promote good reproducibility practices.
