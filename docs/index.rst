HuracanPy
=========

A python package for working with various forms of feature tracking data, including but not restricted to cyclone tracks.

Why HuracanPy?
--------------
The idea of this package is to provide a common tool for working with cyclone track data. 
In particular, HuracanPy can read tracks from many different sources/trackers. 
It also provides useful functions to analyse these tracks, including many common diagnostics.
Our goal is to make track data analysis more accessible, and to promote good reproducibility practices.


Installation
------------
To install the package, you can simply use ``pip``::

    pip install huracanpy

This can fail with older python versions due to issues with installing cartopy through
pip. If this happens, use conda to install cartopy first
(e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge cartopy``), then install huracanpy as normal

About xarray
------------
Our package is designed to load track data as xarray objects. 
We recommend you get familiar with xarray to make the most of this package (https://tutorial.xarray.dev/intro.html). 

Package structure
-----------------

The package has several module that allow you to:
* Load cyclone tracks (`load`);
* Add information to your tracks (`info`);
* Subset (`subset`) and interpolate (`interp`) the tracks;
* Compute standard diagnostic metrics  (`calc`);
* Make simple plots (`plot`);
* Compare several datasets between them (`assess`).
The flowchart below illustrates this structure.
