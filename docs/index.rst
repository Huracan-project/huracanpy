HuracanPy
=========

A python package for working with various forms of feature tracking data, including but not restricted to cyclone tracks.

Statement of need
-----------------
The idea of this package is to be a standard way for working with cyclone track data. We
were all working on track data, but in slightly different ways which makes sharing code
more difficult.

Installation
------------
To install the package, you can use ``pip``::

    pip install huracanpy

This can fail with older python versions due to issues with installing cartopy through
pip. If this happens, use conda to install cartopy first
(e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge cartopy``), then install huracanpy as normal

About xarray
------------
Our package is designed to load track data as xarray objects. 
We recommend you get familiar with xarray to make the most of this package (https://tutorial.xarray.dev/intro.html). 

Package structure
-----------------

The package has several module that allow you to:
* Add information to your tracks (e.g. geographical info, translation speed, etc.);
* Subset part of the tracks;
* Compute standard diagnostic metrics;
* Make simple plots;
* Compare several datasets between them.
The flowchart below illustrates this structure.

Please subscribe to the mailing list [TBA] to get information about HuracanPy. 

If you encounter any problem while using HuracanPy, please create an issue in GitHub (or consider contributing to the package!) 

Contributing to HuracanPy
-------------------------
Although this package was created within the scope of the Hurac√°n project, anyone is welcome to contribute. 
In particular, we welcome any contributions to extend the package beyond cyclone communities.
Please get in touch if you wish to contribute!
