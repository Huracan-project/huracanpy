*A python package for working with various forms of feature tracking data, including but not restricted to cyclone tracks.*

**Why HuracanPy?**
The idea of this package is to provide a unified tool for working with cyclone track data. 
In particular, HuracanPy can read tracks from many different sources/trackers. 
It also provides useful functions to analyse these tracks, including many common diagnostics.
Our goal is to make track data analysis more accessible, and to promote good reproducibility practices.


**Getting started?** Head to the User Guide below! Do not forget:

* This package is distributed under the `MIT licence <https://github.com/Huracan-project/huracanpy/blob/main/LICENSE>`_.

* There is a `JOSS paper`_ documenting HuracanPy. We ask that you cite it in published papers using HuracanPy. This help us get credit for the work we put in the development, and also to track how the package is used.
