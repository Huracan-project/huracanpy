Package structure
-----------------

The package has several module that allow you to:
* Load cyclone tracks (`load`);
* Add information to your tracks (`info`);
* Subset (`subset`) and interpolate (`interp`) the tracks;
* Compute standard diagnostic metrics  (`calc`);
* Make simple plots (`plot`);
* Compare several datasets between them (`assess`).
The flowchart below illustrates this structure.
