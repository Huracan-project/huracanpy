# Installation

You can install huracanpy with conda
```bash
conda install -c conda-forge huracanpy
```
or pip
```bash
pip install huracanpy
```
For older python versions, the pip installation may fail due to issues with installing cartopy through pip. If this happens, use conda to install cartopy first (e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge cartopy``), then install huracanpy.
