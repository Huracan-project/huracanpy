Installation
============

To install the package, you can use ``pip``::

    pip install huracanpy

This can fail with older python versions due to issues with installing cartopy through
pip. If this happens, use conda to install cartopy first
(e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge cartopy``), then install huracanpy as normal
