Installation
============

To install the package, you can use ``pip``::

    pip install huracanpy

Nota Bene:

#. We support Python 3.9 to 3.13.
#. The installation may fail due to issues with installing cartopy through pip. If this happens, use conda to install cartopy first (e.g. ``conda install -c conda-forge cartopy``), then install huracanpy as normal.
