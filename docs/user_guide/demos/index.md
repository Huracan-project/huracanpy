# Example workflows
In this notebook, we demonstrate the type of analysis workflow you can build using HuracanPy. To know more about the available options and functions, please go through the [huracanpy.load guide](../load.ipynb), and/or browse the [API documentation](../../api/index.rst). The [example gallery](../../examples/index.rst) gallery also provides useful demonstrations.

We show three workflows:

```{toctree}

maxdepth: 1
numbered:

single_cyclone
set_of_tracks
tracks_vs_obs
```
