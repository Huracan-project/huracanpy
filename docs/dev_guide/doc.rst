Sphinx
~~~~~~
The present documentation is built with `Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/master/>`_. If you installed `huracanPy` following the developers' instruction, you should have the following package installed in your environment: 
* `sphinx`
* `pydata-sphinx-theme`
* `nbsphinx`
* `sphinx-copybutton`

All documentations files are in the `docs` folder at the root of the package. They are either `.rst` (reStructured Text) or `.ipynb` (Jupyter Notebook, which includes MarkDown) files.


.. hint::
    | To build the documentation locally, run `make html` in this folder. This is useful to preview your changes before you commit them.
